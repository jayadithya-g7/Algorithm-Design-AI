Graph Search Algorithms
-

Overview:
-

This repository serves as a practical, well-documented resource for fundamental graph search algorithms. 

It contains clean, C++ implementations of both informed and uninformed search techniques, each accompanied by a dedicated README file to explain its core concepts and code structure. 

The project is designed to be a learning tool for students and developers interested in artificial intelligence, algorithm design, and graph theory.

What's Inside?
-

The repository is organized by algorithm, with a dedicated directory for each one. Each directory includes a C++ source file (.cpp) and a detailed README.md that explains the algorithm, its implementation, and provides a sample input and output.


The algorithms included in this repository are:

A* Search: An informed, optimal search algorithm that uses a heuristic to guide its search for the shortest path.

Beam Search: A heuristic search algorithm that explores a fixed number of the most promising nodes at each level.

Breadth-First Search (BFS): An uninformed search that finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs by exploring all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

British Museum Search: A brute-force, exhaustive search that finds all possible paths from a start node to a goal node.

Branch & Bound: A systematic search algorithm that prunes branches of the search tree that are guaranteed not to lead to an optimal solution. This repository includes versions with heuristics and an oracle.

Depth-First Search (DFS): An uninformed search that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Hill Climbing: A greedy, heuristic search algorithm that always moves to the neighbor that appears closest to the goal.
